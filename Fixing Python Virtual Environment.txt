Sometimes, it may not be possible to install all the python libraries, and packages in program files due to administrative access issue,
and that may force to install python in a different directory other than program files.

Though the installation directory is different, the interpreter in pycharm may always point to the old location, and hence we may receive
error whenever we try to install packages. To overcome this issue, follow the steps below:

1. Create a virtual environment from PyCharm menu and use the environment for installing all packages
2. Virtual Environment can be created by navigating to File - Settings - Project Interpreter - Click the gear icon just next to the
interpreter list of address bar, where you can define the path and name of the virtual environment
3. Now from the terminal, navigate to the virtual environement folder, and then you can install packages to this virtual environment 
using python -m pip install package_name
4. Go to File - Settings - Project Interpreter - From the project interpreter list click Show All, and select the virtual environment
project interpreter, and click the option "Show All Paths". Make sure that only paths associated with the virtual environment are available
here. Remove anything that is not part of the virtual environment.

Now you should able to install packages and import packages without any issues
